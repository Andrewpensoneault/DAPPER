    "Modern DA builds on state estimation techniques such as the Kalman filter (KF), which is a recursive least-squares regression algorithm. It was developed to steer the Apollo mission rockets to the moon, but also has applications outside of control systems, such as speech recognition, video tracking, and finance. An [introduction by pictures](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/) is provided by Tim Babb. An [interactive tutorial](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python) has been made by Roger Labbe.\n",
