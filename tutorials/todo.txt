 b) Multivariate inference: Kriging
  - random field (is random vector, is random variable)
  - if one data point: estimate same
  - if two data points: estimate weighted (precision) mean
  - if more: Kriging, with assigned covariance or variogram
  - Repeat regression example, now also with unknown x0
 c) Linear regression
  - brings it back to state space
  - vs finite diff
  - min var, min err
  - posterior mean
 d) Woodbury (Morrison)
  - props of covar (spd, spectral th, inversion, sqrroots, generalizes error bars)
  - Direct proof
  - Use to yield EnKF
  - SVD and block manipulation is an alternative

Why is filtering called filtering?
  Not coz it makes output smoother than input.
  But coz it has historical connections to signal proc.
  Note: also has connexs to time series analysis, kriging, regression, etc.
